**Action vs. Thing**

Like a recipe code is

Console.log(xxx)

xxx”Hello”

console.log(”Hello”)

The action we want the computer to perform is console.log which is to print on screen the thing

The thing code is to tell the computer what to print ex: “Hello, world!”

The computer knows this text is not code due to syntax highlighting

Ending a Sentence of Code**;**

console.log("Hello, world");
console.log("Hello again!");
console.log("It's me!");
console.log("My name is Conner");
